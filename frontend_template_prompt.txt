"Build a frontend POC using Tailwind CSS with a Modern Enterprise SaaS aesthetic. Use a Slate and Indigo color palette.
Key Styles to include:
Background: Use bg-slate-50 for the page and bg-white for primary cards.
Typography: Use font-black tracking-tight for main headings in slate-800. Use ui-monospace for data/code blocks.
Cards: Use rounded-2xl for containers with shadow-sm and subtle border-slate-200.
Headers: Every card should have a distinct header with bg-slate-50 and a border-b.
Accents: Use Indigo-600 for primary buttons and status indicators.
Interaction: Include Font Awesome icons, smooth transitions, and animate-pulse for loading states.
Layout: A clean, responsive grid (usually 2 columns) with wide gutters."
